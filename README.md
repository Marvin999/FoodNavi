This web app uses vue3 compositions, html5, CSS to create an interactive user interface that allows the user to create and save cooking recipes recipes they are interested in. The user can add an image, nutritional data, ingredients, and cooking step instructions to a recipe upon creation.
These recipes are then displayed via the "Home" tab where the user can browse through all saved recipes.
The user can click on recipes they are interested in from the "Home" tab which will take the user to an indiviual recipe description where if the user likes the recipe they can heart the recipe, the user will also be able to add that recipe to their "Meal Plan."
Recipes added to the meal plan will be displayed in the "Meal Plan" tab where they can track recipes they plan to make
The User Is also able to add Ingredients to their Pantry via the "Pantry" tab. This feature is intended to be used so that the user will know what they have in their food stores, which will help prevent buying ingredients for meals that they might already have.
All recipes can be updated or deleted if the user wishes, though removing recipes from the "Meal Plan" will not delete that recipe from the "Home" tab. User is also able to delete items from the "Pantry tab"
